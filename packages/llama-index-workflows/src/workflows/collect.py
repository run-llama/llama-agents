"""Collect selection algebra.

The ``Collect`` marker and ``Cardinality`` hierarchy let a step declare *how* a
batch fan-in parameter is released. They are used inside ``Annotated`` on a
``list[E]`` parameter::

    async def fastest(
        events: Annotated[list[Result], Collect(Take(1))],
    ) -> StopEvent: ...

A bare ``list[E]`` parameter is exactly equivalent to ``Collect(All())`` — fire
once when the batch closes with every collected event. ``Annotated[list[E],
Collect()]`` is an explicit, grep-able synonym for the same default.

Only the v1 cardinalities (``All`` / ``Take``) are implemented. ``AtLeast`` is
deferred to v2: its only difference from ``Take`` ("continue accepting" the
siblings that arrive after release) is unobservable without v2 re-fire
(``Buffer`` / ``Window``) or a cancellation primitive, so in v1 it would be a
silent alias of ``Take``. ``Buffer`` / ``Window`` (streaming aggregation) are
also v2. The ``at`` / ``from_`` / ``where`` knobs are accepted on the marker but
not yet wired into the runtime — declaring them raises a clear validation error.
